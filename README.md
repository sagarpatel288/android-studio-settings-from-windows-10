I would import this settings whenever I need to work on different machine with different android studio config settings. This settings contain many live templates and key maps.

## Export Settings
On the computer where the IntelliJ IDEA instance whose settings you want to share is installed, select File | Settings Repository from the main menu. Specify the URL of the repository you've created and click Overwrite Remote.

## Import Settings
On each computer where you want your settings to be applied, in the Settings/Preferences dialog (Ctrl+Alt+S), expand the Tools node and choose Settings Repository. Specify the URL of the repository you've created, and click Overwrite Local.

You can click Merge if you want the repository to keep a combination of the remote settings and your local settings. If any conflicts are detected, a dialog will be displayed where you can resolve these conflicts.

If you want to overwrite the remote settings with your local settings, click Overwrite Remote.
